# Usage Tracking

_Google Listings & Ads_ implements usage tracking, based on the native [WooCommerce Usage Tracking](https://woocommerce.com/usage-tracking/), and is only enabled when WooCommerce Tracking is enabled.

When a store opts in to WooCommerce usage tracking and uses _Google Listings & Ads_, they will also be opted in to the tracking added by _Google Listings & Ads_.

## What is tracked

As in WooCommerce core, only non-sensitive data about how a store is set up and managed is tracked. We **do not track or store personal data** from your clients.

* Plugin version
* Settings
  * WordPress.com account connection status
  * Google Merchant center account connection status

<!-- TODO: add more tracking information -->

## Developer Info
All new tracking info should be updated in this readme.

New snapshot data for **WC Tracker** should be hooked into `Tracking\Events\TrackerSnapshot::include_snapshot_data()`.

New **Tracks** events should be created in `Tracking\Events\Events` (extending `Tracking\Events\BaseEvent`), and need to be registered in `Tracking\Events\EventTracking::$events`. They should also be registered in the `Internal\DependencyManagement\CoreServiceProvider` class:

```php
$this->conditionally_share_with_tags( Loaded::class );
```
