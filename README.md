After cloning the repo, install dependencies:

 - `npm install` to install JavaScript dependencies.
 - `composer install` to gather PHP dependencies.

Now you can build the files using one of these commands:

 - `npm run build` : Build a production version
 - `npm run dev` : Build a development version
 - `npm run start` : Build a development version, watch files for changes

## Helper Scripts

There are a number of helper scripts exposed via our package.json (below list is not exhaustive, you can view the [package.json file directly](https://github.com/woocommerce/google-listings-and-ads/blob/trunk/package.json#L11) to see all):

 - `npm run lint:js` : Run eslint over the javascript files
 - `npm run lint:css` : Run stylelint over the javascript files
 - `npm run test-unit` : Run the JS test suite
 - `npm run test-unit:watch` : Run the JS test suite, watch for changes

## WordPress Code Standards

After running `composer install` to install PHP dependencies you can use the following command to run php code standards checks:

 - `./vendor/bin/phpcs`

## PHPUnit

After running `composer install` to install PHP dependencies you can use the following command run php unit tests:

 - `./vendor/bin/phpunit`

(Installation process TBC)

## E2E Testing

E2E testing uses [@woocommerce/e2e-environment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@woocommerce/e2e-environment) which requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

Make sure Docker is running in your machine, and run the following:

`npm run docker:up` - This will automatically download and run WordPress in a Docker container. You can access it at http://localhost:8084 (Username: admin, Password: password).

Run E2E testing:

- `npm run test:e2e` to run the test in headless mode.
- `npm run test:e2e-dev` to run the tests in Chromium browser.

To remove the Docker container and images (this will **delete everything** in the WordPress Docker container):

`npm run docker:down`
