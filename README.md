## Development

After cloning the repo, install dependencies:
-   `nvm use` to be sure you're using the recommended node version in `.nvmrc`
-   `npm install` to install JavaScript dependencies.
-   `composer install` to gather PHP dependencies.

Now you can build the files using one of these commands:

-   `npm run build` : Build a production version
-   `npm run dev` : Build a development version
-   `npm run start` : Build a development version, watch files for changes

## Helper Scripts

There are a number of helper scripts exposed via our package.json (below list is not exhaustive, you can view the [package.json file directly](https://github.com/woocommerce/google-listings-and-ads/blob/trunk/package.json#L11) to see all):

-   `npm run lint:js` : Run eslint over the javascript files
-   `npm run lint:css` : Run stylelint over the javascript files
-   `npm run test:js` : Run the JS test suite
-   `npm run test:js:watch` : Run the JS test suite, watch for changes

## WordPress Code Standards

After running `composer install` to install PHP dependencies you can use the following command to run php code standards checks:

-   `./vendor/bin/phpcs`

## PHPUnit

### Prerequisites

Install [`composer`](https://getcomposer.org/), `git`, `npm`, `svn`, and either `wget` or `curl`.

Change to the plugin root directory and type:

```bash
$ composer install
```

Change to the plugin root directory and type:

```bash
$ npm install && npm run dev
```

### Install Test Dependencies

To run the unit tests you need WordPress, [WooCommerce](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce), and the WordPress Unit Test lib (included in the [core development repository](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/automated-testing/phpunit/)).

Install them using the `install-wp-tests.sh` script:

```bash
$ ./bin/install-wp-tests.sh <db-name> <db-user> <db-pass> <db-host>
```

Example:

```bash
$ ./bin/install-wp-tests.sh wordpress_tests root root localhost
```

This script installs the test dependencies into your system's temporary directory and also creates a test database.

You can also specify the path to their directories by setting the following environment variables:

-   `WP_TESTS_DIR`: WordPress Unit Test lib directory
-   `WP_CORE_DIR`: WordPress core directory
-   `WC_DIR`: WooCommerce directory

### Running Tests

Change to the plugin root directory and type:

```bash
$ vendor/bin/phpunit
```

The tests will execute and you'll be presented with a summary.

### Unit Tests and PHP 8

We support running unit tests on PHP 8.

In order to have tests running, please, execute the following line just before the `phpunit` call:
```
composer require phpunit/phpunit "^9.5" --dev --update-with-all-dependencies
```

The above will update PHPUnit to version 9 including all of its dependencies.

**NOTE!** Do not commit the changes made, committing `phpunit/phpunit: ^9.5` dependency changes to `composer.json` file will break the CI. 

## E2E Testing

E2E testing uses [@woocommerce/e2e-environment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@woocommerce/e2e-environment) which requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

Make sure Docker is running in your machine, and run the following:

`npm run docker:up` - This will automatically download and run WordPress in a Docker container. You can access it at http://localhost:8084 (Username: admin, Password: password).

Run E2E testing:

-   `npm run test:e2e` to run the test in headless mode.
-   `npm run test:e2e-dev` to run the tests in Chromium browser.

To remove the Docker container and images (this will **delete everything** in the WordPress Docker container):

`npm run docker:down`
