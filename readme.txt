By syncing your product information to [Google Merchant Center](https://woocommerce.com/document/google-for-woocommerce/#connect-your-store-with-google-merchant-center), your products can appear in relevant Google searches, Shopping tab, image searches, and even on other platforms like YouTube. When running [Performance Max campaigns](https://woocommerce.com/document/google-for-woocommerce/get-started/google-performance-max-campaigns/), Google Merchant Center ensures that shoppers see the most up-to-date and accurate information about your product feed, reducing confusion and improving the chances of a purchase.
